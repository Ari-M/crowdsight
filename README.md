# CrowdSight


## About

### Current / MVP 
CrowdSight is a simple text message managment web application where you can create groups and send mass text messages to them. Utilizing the Twilio API, it is really simple to create a group and know what the group is for, and knowing all the members of the group. This is great for use cases in where you want to increase your probablity of someone reciving your message, for example, like managing an event or small group. The current MVP displays the ability to create groups, list contacts of a group, find groups, and send messages to any group independently of each other.

### Original Idea / Stretch Features 
Crowdsight's main focus was on event and group managment, with the advent of web technology and more accessible communication online, text messaging has remained one of the most popular forms of communication. Companies in industry's like tech and banking utilize this form of communication for introducing two factor authentication, or for notifying people of their nearby driver. This same communication system would integrate wonderfully into mass event/group managment. 

#### Intended Features
*	The ability to create an event with a custom url to where people can apply to that event online or be included in a private group
*	The form must include at least the person's name and phone number
*	Upon completion, the user receives a text explaining that they have sucessfully subscribed for event/group notfiications
*	The manager can from then on program SMS to send out reminders or any other information aabout an event or group on a particular time and date
*	There are custom reponses that can be used in response to a group type. For instance, if a member subscribed to the system wanted to leave, 	they could simply reply 'leave' and they would no longer receive messages
*	Only managers would need accounts, with the members not necessarily even needing interaction with the site, unless they were applying for a 	public event



### User Stories

| User        | Use  |        
| ------------|:------------:|
| Event Manager   | As an event manager, social media platforms are great for spreading information, but when it comes to communicating to people with actual plans to attend an event, it doesn't suffice to support real communication. CrowdSight would be an amazing asset to my work, as it would personally communicate with the attendees and their replies can give me a more accurate statement of the status of an event, or I can even give them information in the event where plans have changed. |
| Program Manager | Managing groups of any size can be difficult, and having a standardized form of communication is always the most effective and straight-forward way of leading a group to attain goals. Organization can be especially difficult. Using CrowdSight, I can customize reminders to notify workers of deadlines or they can send back certain responses that can notify me of their progress, giving me real evidence backed results that I can use to better help my team
